**OmiAD: One-Step Adaptive Masked Diffusion Model for Multi-class Anomaly Detection via Adversarial Distillation (ICML 2025)**

## Abstract
Diffusion models have demonstrated outstanding performance in industrial anomaly detection. However, their iterative denoising nature results in slow inference speed, limiting their practicality for real-time industrial deployment. To address this challenge, we propose OmiAD, a one-step masked diffusion model for multi-class anomaly detection, derived from a well-designed multi-step **A**daptive **M**asked **D**iffusion **M**odel (AMDM) and compressed using **A**dversarial **S**core **D**istillation (ASD). OmiAD first introduces AMDM, equipped with an adaptive masking strategy that dynamically adjusts masking patterns based on noise levels and encourages the model to reconstruct anomalies as normal counterparts by leveraging broader context, to reduce the pixel-level shortcut reliance. Then, ASD  is developed to compress the multi-step diffusion process into a single-step generator by score distillation and incorporating a shared-weight discriminator effectively reusing parameters while significantly improving both inference efficiency and detection performance. The effectiveness of OmiAD is validated on four diverse datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven metrics while delivering a remarkable inference speedup.

## 3. Quick Start
**3.1 Datasets**
- **Create the MVTec-AD dataset directory**. The datasets can be downloaded from [MVTec-AD](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/), [VisA](https://github.com/amazon-science/spot-diff), [MPDD](https://github.com/stepanje/MPDD), [RealIAD](https://github.com/Tencent/AnomalyDetection_Real-IAD).  Unzip the file and move some to `./my_data/MVTec-AD/`. To ensure consistency across datasets, please run `make_visa_dataset.py` and `make_realiad_dataset.py` to convert the VisA and RealAd datasets into the same format as MVTec-AD and MPDD.

**3.2 Training**
- **Generate dataset JSON files** Run `make_json.py` inside the `./data/` directory to generate the dataset JSON files.

- **Train the AMDM model:** Run `train_AMDM` inside the `./main/` directory to train the AMDM model.

- **Train the OmiAD:** Run `train_OmiAD` inside the `./main/` directory to train the OmiAD model. Make sure to set `args.e = False`.

**3.3 Testing**

- **Test the OmiAD:** Run `train_OmiAD` inside the `./main/` directory to train the OmiAD model. Make sure to set `args.e = True`.

- **Noting:**
We have also released our well-trained checkpoint on MVTec,VisA,MPDD,RealIAD at: ------, Extract code：-----. It is free to download the checkpoint and put it at `\experiments\MVTec-AD\G_checkpoints\G_ckpt_best.pth.tar`

**3.4 Visualize Reconstructed Features**
- **Train Decoders for Visualization:** Run `train_decoder.py` inside the `./main/` directory to train decoder. 

- **Visualize Reconstructed Features:** Run `vis_rec.py` inside the ./main/ directory to train the decoder.

    **Note:** Please make sure **args.make_npy** is set to True when running train_OmiAD.py beforehand.
